# trajectory-calculation-for-stratospheric-balloon
This small program calculates the trajectory of a stratospheric balloon based on the location and the currently selected date. 

🎈 Trajectory calculation

- Calculates the expected trajectory of weather balloons/high-altitude research balloons
- Uses current meteorological data (wind, temperature, air pressure)
- Takes into account ascent and descent phases

📊 Input parameters:

- Start position (GPS coordinates)
- Start time
- Ascent rate (how fast the balloon rises)
- Burst altitude (where the balloon bursts)
- Descent rate (parachute speed)

📍 Output:

- Complete flight path as GPS coordinates
- Estimated landing point
- Timestamp for each point
- Altitude data
